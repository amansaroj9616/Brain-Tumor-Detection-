## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting **brain tumors** from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It uses image classification techniques in deep learning to accurately distinguish between tumor and non-tumor brain scans.

The model can be trained on a labeled dataset and tested for real-time applications, potentially aiding radiologists in medical diagnostics.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 📊 NumPy, Matplotlib
- 🧠 TensorFlow / Keras
- 🖼 OpenCV / PIL
- 📝 Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧬 Dataset

The dataset used contains **MRI images** of human brains categorized into:
- `yes` — Brain Tumor Present
- `no` — No Brain Tumor

Each image is preprocessed and resized for consistent input to the CNN.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- ✅ Binary classification using CNN
- ✅ Accuracy and loss visualization
- ✅ Sample predictions with visual output
